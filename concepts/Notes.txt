// Socket.io
- Socket.lO is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients (browsers)
  and servers. It simplifies the process of building interactive web applications by allowing data to be transmitted instantly and
  continuously between the client and server, facilitating features like chat applications, live updates, and multiplayer gaming.

// Bidirectional communication
- Bidirectional communication means that information can flow in&Wo directions, both the web client (browser) and the server can send
  and receive data to and from each other in real-time. 
- So, if something changes on the server, it can immediately notify the client, and vice versa, without the client needing to constantly ask
  the server if there's new information available.

// io.on("connection", callback)
- io.on is a method used to register event listeners for different events that occur on the server-side. 
- The io object represents the main Socket.lO server instance.
- When we call io.on(‘connection’, callback), we're telling Socket.IO to listen for a connection event, which occurs whenever a new client
  establishes a connection with the server. The callback function will be called/invoked whenever this event occurs, and it will receive a
  socket object representing the connection to the client.
- Similarly, we can use socket.on on the socket object to listen for events specific to that individual client connection.

// Emitting events
- Emitting events allows us to send data from one side (client or server) to the other.
- It's a fundamental feature of real-time communication.
